The PC version is in on my c-drive in the directory 

                program files\emmixgene


To compile programs needed by EMMIX-GENE, use the programs icon to go to 

                Compaq Visual Fortran 6
                Fortran command prompt

cd to appropriate directory by

                cd \microarrays\emmix-gene

To compile program emmix.f using FORTRAN 90 program, type

                f90 /fast emmix.f

After file has been compiled, move the execution file emmix.exe to the
directory program files/emmixgene, type

                 mv emmix.exe c:\program files\emmixgene

If that doesn't work, replace program files by prog~1

To look at what is in the directory, type

                 dir


To run EMMIX-GENE, use the programs icon to go to
                /programs file/emmixgene
